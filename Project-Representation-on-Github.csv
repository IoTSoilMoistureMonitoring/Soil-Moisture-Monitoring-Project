"Title 	Of  Project:"
"""Smart Agriculture monitoring moisture by using a Moisture sensor"""
""
"Introduction"
"How a Moisture sensor does it work?"
"Moisture is critical for plant growth, so a soil moisture meter sensor not only aids in keeping vegetables  during periods of drought but also helps gardeners decide when to water, especially when climate change. Expensive professional meters use a variety of measurement methods, many requiring permanent probes wired together, but home meters are typically handheld devices utilizing electrical resistance or water pressure and a digital interface to measure moisture inside a soil."
"In Agriculture Measuring soil moisture is important for agricultural applications to help farmers manage their irrigation systems in a splendid way which is very effective. Knowing the exact soil moisture conditions on their fields, not only are farmers able to generally use less water to grow a crop, they are also able to increase yields productions  and the quality of the crop by improved management of soil moisture during critical plant growth stages."
"In Research Soil moisture sensors are used in numerous research applications, e.g. in agriculture for the Scientifics  and other domain  including irrigation planning,  the  climate change  research, on environmental science  and as auxiliary sensors for soil respiration measurements."
"For our project of monitoring level of water in soil by detecting moisture, we will use capacitive moisture sensor and we will upload the datas we get on  Ubidot cloud to visualise the change of different state of soil. The necessary information are shown  in the slides below:"
